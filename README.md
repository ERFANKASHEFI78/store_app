# Store App

**Store App** is a practice application developed for **Farahoush Company** as part of my **second internship project** with the company. 

The app demonstrates basic concepts of database management and UI integration in Flutter. Although the user interface is simple, the underlying code incorporates important database concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **Shared Preferences** for local storage
- **SQLite** for relational database management
- **Hive** for lightweight NoSQL database storage

The main goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with Flutter database operations while keeping the UI straightforward and easy to navigate.
